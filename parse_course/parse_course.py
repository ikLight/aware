You are an expert instructional designer creating a knowledge graph from a set of course documents. Analyze the content of all the attached files to create a single, unified knowledge graph, synthesizing the information across all documents.

Your output must be a single JSON object with two keys: "nodes" and "edges".

1.  The "nodes" key must have a value that is a list of strings, where each string is a core concept, skill, or topic found in the documents.
2.  The "edges" key must have a value that is a list of objects. Each object must represent a relationship and have three keys: "source" (the starting concept), "target" (the ending concept), and "relationship" (a string describing the connection, like 'is_prerequisite_for' or 'is_an_example_of').

Ensure that the 'source' and 'target' concepts in the 'edges' list are present in the 'nodes' list.
